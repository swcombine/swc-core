(defun get
(say "A lot of groups sell them directly, so contacting them when they advertise is a good opportunity. However most stocks are traded on the open market by individuals or groups.")

(say "This can be quite tricky. A lot of groups and companies get by without releasing any stock at all. Some can only release a limited amount and this is kept within their leadership.")

(defun loan

(defun account
(say "Really? This service is generally a bit rarer than loans because it involves a lot more work, and there is a real possibility that they bankrupt themselves by taking on too many accounts.")
(say "Generally though they will take your credits and then add a set percentage to it each month or year, allowing you to remove funds at certain points.")
(add-response "Hmm, might not need one now." general))

(defun oservice
(say "Yes. Some will keep a track on the stockmarket, some may keep bounty lists, others may hold an exchange rate booth. For as many ways as there are to use credits, there are almost the same amount of ways to use money and information about money.")
